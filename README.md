### Milestone 1 README

For this project, we will be creating R packages that implement k-means clustering from scratch. This will work on any dataset with valid numerical features and includes fit, predict, and summarize functions, as well as elbow and silhouette methods for hyperparameter “k” optimization.  

+ fit: Outputs a list of cluster centers based on the inputted dataset and number of clusters. Only clustered based on valid numerical features.  

+ predict: Assigns each point in a dataset to a cluster. Dataset has to be in the same format as the original dataset the model was fit on.  

+ cluster_summary: Outputs a summary of clusters created including centroid coordinates, number of data points in training data assigned to each cluster, and within-cluster distance metrics.  

+ elbow: Plots the number of clusters vs inertia. It helps to choose the optimal number of clusters.   

+ silhouette: Plots the number of clusters vs Silhouette score. It helps to choose the optimal number of clusters.    

There is a built-in k-means function in R. This package is not meant to add to the existing ecosystem; they are rather intended to deepen our fundamental understanding of these algorithms.
